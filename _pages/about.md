Hi! I am Tifaout. I am currently a third year PhD student in Operations Research at [INRIA de L'Université de Lille](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-luniversite-de-lille) under the supervision of [Martine Labbé](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WS_O3bIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Frédéric Semet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6iUyQhMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Diego Cattaruzza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNvqTXoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) all being part of team [INOCs](https://team.inria.fr/inocs/).

I hold my Computer Science Master's degree in OPtimization and ALgorithmics (OPAL) from [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr) in 2019, in Metz. This Master's focuses on algorithms and modeling for decision-making problems, covering both exact and approximate methods in Combinatorial Optimization. It includes deterministic approaches, the study of complexity, guaranteed approximation for NP-hard problems, and advanced techniques derived from graph theory.

My PhD topic is Advanced Optimization Algorithms for Group Testing. I tackle the studied problem with Combinatorial Optimization techniques and exact methods.

I am Interested more generally in Combinatorial Optimization.
