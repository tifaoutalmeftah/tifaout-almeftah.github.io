Hi! I am Tifaout. I am currently a third year PhD student in Operations Research at [INRIA de L'Université de Lille](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-luniversite-de-lille) under the supervision of [Martine Labbé](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WS_O3bIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Frédéric Semet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6iUyQhMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Diego Cattaruzza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNvqTXoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) all being part of team [INOCs](https://team.inria.fr/inocs/).

I hold my Computer Science Master's degree in OPtimization and ALgorithmics (OPAL) from [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr) in 2019, in Metz. This Master's focuses on algorithms and modeling for decision-making problems, covering both exact and approximate methods in Combinatorial Optimization. It includes deterministic approaches, the study of complexity, guaranteed approximation for NP-hard problems, and advanced techniques derived from graph theory.

My PhD topic is Advanced Optimization Algorithms for Group Testing. I tackle the studied problem with Combinatorial Optimization techniques and exact methods.

I have a deep passion for Combinatorial Optimization problems, especially when they have real-world applications that spark my curiosity. I am driven by the challenge of using my skills—and constantly learning new ones—to solve complex, integrated problems. My interests span a wide range of fields, from healthcare logistics and staff planning to national security. I find immense satisfaction in modeling problems, designing algorithms, and implementing solutions.

Certain domains captivate me more than others. I'm particularly passionate about the Air and Space Industry, Marine Transportation, Hospitals, and national security and public safety . But in a broader sense, I'm always excited by the prospect of working on Mega Projects, highly complex systems, and critical infrastructures. These areas, with their immense scale and intricacy, are where I feel most inspired to make a meaningful impact.
